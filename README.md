Hello!
here is my final solution. 
It's a bit wonky mut it makes do in my opinion. I've chosen to use local json files as my databse as i couldn't get mongodb to work.
As for Azure developement i tried multiple ways of making a fat jar that would be possible to deploy but through all my efforts i couldnt make it start the Express server and the frontend.
its started by running the start-server script in package.json then running the start script.
All tests run green.
A known bug is that for some reason the server stops responing at random times, solution is to restart server.
Accounts that can be used are in the users.json file
the one i used for debugging is johnDoe and password hello
